If you were hiring a developer today, what would be the primary quality you'd look for in that person? What characteristic do you consider essential?

Many people emphasize adaptability and the ability to reinvent oneself constantly. While that's an important trait, in my view, one of the most significant quality in a developer is <strong>the ability to analyze cost versus benefit</strong>. In short, the ability to make good decisions.

Consider the following scenario: you come across a completely disorganized file, with multiple issues, and full of low-quality code. Refactoring that file comes at a cost, but many people calculate this cost incorrectly, focusing only on the time it would take them personally to complete the task. For instance, if refactoring the code would take four hours, is it reasonable to assume the total cost is just four hours?

No. After the refactoring, other developers will need to review your changes. It's likely you'll need to make additional adjustments based on their feedback. Moreover, the QA team will have to test all the flows affected by the modifications, and there's always the risk of introducing a new bug that could impact the end user.

How is your team doing right now? Do they have the time to handle this extra work? Is this the right moment to undertake such a refactor? A good developer must be able to assess these factors, considering not just their work but the broader context of the team and the company.

Another example is choosing technologies for a new project. Many developers pick something they want to work with or whatever is trending at the moment. They focus on their preferences rather than the company's context. When selecting a technology, various factors need to be taken into account: Is it well-established? Is it easy to hire developers to work with this technology? Is it truly the best solution for the problem your team is currently facing?

Once again, analyzing the broader context is crucial, yet many developers overlook this. I always perform an exercise when I need to make a more comprehensive assessment: If this were my company, what would I do?

We make decisions like these every day. It's critically important to evaluate the broader context of each situation. Only then can we make better decisions.
