      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-24 mb-8 font-bold text-[#212830] font-display">How I'll Make a Difference</h2>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        I'm a versatile engineer who can adapt to different roles—whether it's diving deep into technical challenges, refining UX design, or navigating big-picture business decisions. I'm comfortable working with everyone, from executives to engineers, and I adapt to what the team needs. No matter where I contribute, I keep the broader business goals in mind and strive to make a positive impact in every space I work in.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-16 mb-8 font-bold text-[#212830] font-display">Strengths</h2>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis</strong> – I see this as one of the most important skills in programming. Understanding trade-offs is key to making good technical decisions. <a href="/blog/best-quality-in-a-software-developer" class="hover:text-[#b8b836] underline text-[#959544] transition-all">I even wrote an article on this topic</a> and continuously work to refine this ability in my day-to-day work.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Embracing Feedback</strong> – I actively seek and value constructive criticism because I see it as one of the best ways to grow. I love discussing ideas and have no problem admitting when mine aren’t the best—it’s all part of improving and learning.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Teamwork & Support</strong> – I believe that great teams are built on trust, collaboration, and a willingness to help each other grow. I enjoy working closely with teammates, not just to get things done, but to create an environment where everyone feels supported and valued. I’m always happy to share knowledge, offer feedback, and step in when someone needs a hand.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-16 mb-8 font-bold text-[#212830] font-display">Weaknesses</h2>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Impatience with Bureaucracy</strong> – I like getting things done efficiently, so I sometimes get frustrated with slow processes or unnecessary red tape. That said, I'm learning to navigate these challenges with patience and find ways to work within constraints while still driving progress.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Discomfort with Giving Criticism</strong> – I value open communication and constructive feedback, but I sometimes hesitate to give direct criticism. I'm working on finding the right balance—delivering honest feedback in a way that's clear, helpful, and encourages growth.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        <strong>Difficulties Delegating Tasks</strong> – I've gotten better at this over time, but I tend to take ownership of my work, which sometimes makes it hard for me to delegate. However, I've learned to trust my teammates, knowing that sharing responsibilities leads to better outcomes and a stronger team.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl mt-16 mb-8 font-bold text-[#212830] font-display">Expectations</h2>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        Culture is what I value most in a company. A good environment with good values is the key to attracting great people. I thrive in places that value ownership and autonomy, where people are trusted to do their best work.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-7 leading-8 text-[#212830] font-serif">
        I'm also in it for the long run. I don't jump between companies or take on multiple jobs at once—I look for meaningful challenges and commit to them. Over the past eight years, I've worked with just two companies. I left the first one after it was acquired, and I'm still with the second. My current team is amazing, but I'm ready for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
      </p>
